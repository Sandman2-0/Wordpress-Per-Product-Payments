# Wordpress-Per-Product-Payments Plugin
An e-commerce plugin that provides payment method exclusivity.

# Overview üìù
Based on what products are in a users cart, this plugin allows for certain payment methods to be blocked. This is very useful if you're willing to sell multiple products, each with different payment methods.

# Why‚ùì
After failing to find a plugin that would suit my e-commerce needs, I ended up creating my own. After using my plugin for some time, I decided that I should share it with the world, hoping it'll help other fellow merchants.
